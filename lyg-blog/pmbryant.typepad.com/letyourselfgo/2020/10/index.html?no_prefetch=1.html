A few weeks before filming of <em>Moontide</em> began in November, 1941, Ida was quoted saying: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone has been hoping to get the lead opposite Gabin in his first picture. 
  It may be a little catty, but I'm very happy I got it. 
  <em>(Knoxville News-Sentinel, Oct. 5, 1941)</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Moontide</em> project had been announced seven months earlier, in April 1941, but had been immediately put on hold to allow Gabin several months in which to learn sufficient English. So during that time, which actresses besides Ida were strongly considered for the role opposite Gabin? Here are the candidates I have heard. </p>

<p><strong>Joan Bennett</strong> </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db221200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Joan Bennett" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db221200d img-responsive" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db221200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Joan Bennett" /></a>In a short film on the making of <em>Moontide</em>, produced in 2008 for the DVD release, well-known film historian and TCM personality Robert Osborne gives this information. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The leading lady of the film was actually supposed to be Joan Bennett, 
  who had a contract with 20th Century-Fox. But she got pregnant. 
  So what they did is they borrowed Ida Lupino from Warner Bros. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't have access to internal studio documents, but from publicly available information, I have not been able to corroborate any of this. Taking the items from Osborne's statement in reverse order: first, Lupino had a separate contract with 20th Century-Fox and so was not "borrowed". Second, Joan Bennett was making films almost continually throughout 1941. Any pregnancy she may have had did not interfere with the making of any of the other several films she did that year. Also note that her next child was born in mid-1943, a year-and-a-half after <em>Moontide</em> was in production. Finally, I have not found any mention of Bennett's name in connection with <em>Moontide</em> in those newspapers or trade papers whose archives are available online.</p>

<p>This does not, of course, preclude the possibility that Joan Bennett was the studio's initial choice internally. But the apparent factual problems with the rest of Osborne's statement make me skeptical of the claim that Bennett was ever the top choice. Hopefully I'll be able to find more conclusive evidence one way or the other at some point. </p>

<p><strong>Linda Darnell</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971765e200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Linda Darnell" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971765e200b img-responsive" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971765e200b-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Linda Darnell" /></a><em>Moontide</em> was first announced in mid-April 1941, shortly after Jean Gabin arrived in Hollywood after escaping his French homeland, which had been conquered by the German army the previous summer. No other definitive cast members were mentioned in the announcement, but influential Hollywood columnist Louella Parsons offered this tidbit: "Don't say I told you—but Linda Darnell is the leading candidate for the femme role." </p>

<p>Darnell was 17 years old and still in high school in early 1941. Despite her youth, she had made a big splash over the previous two years at 20th Century—co-starring in several significant films with established star Tyrone Power, including <em>The Mark of Zorro</em> (1940) and <em>Blood and Sand</em> (1941). </p>

<p>Interestingly, after that initial hint from Louella Parsons, Darnell's name is never again mentioned in associate with <em>Moontide</em>—at least not in anything I have been able to find. But there was another possibility that may have paired Darnell with Gabin in his first Hollywood movie. </p>

<p>For a brief time in late May and early June, rumors hit the press that Gabin could be the star of fellow Frenchman Jean Renoir's first American film, <em>Swamp Water</em>. Darnell was lined up for the leading lady. By mid-June, however, this was shot down and <em>Moontide</em> was again first on tap for Gabin, with Ida Lupino mentioned as his co-star. Darnell was dropped from the <em>Swamp Water</em> cast. </p>

<p><strong>Ida Lupino</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db25e200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Ida Lupino" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db25e200d img-responsive" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db25e200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Ida Lupino" /></a>After Louella Parsons' one-time mention of Linda Darnell in April, the next woman named for Gabin's co-star was Ida Lupino. On April 23, barely a week after <em>Moontide</em> was first announced, a brief item in the Los Angeles Times entitled "Gabin's Luck" said "Ida Lupino is reported scheduled to appear opposite Jean Gabin in 'Moontide', his first film for 20th Century-Fox, which is tabbed to start shooting in September." </p>

<p>So that's that, then. Ida had won the role almost immediately, even though the film was still many months away from shooting due to Gabin's need to perfect his English. If Linda Darnell or Joan Bennett or anyone else was considered, it was not for long and none of the competitors' press agents were able to get traction in print. Is that the end of the story? </p>

<p>Mostly, but not quite. Six months is an eternity in Hollywood. </p>

<p><strong>Ginger Rogers</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db2b3200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Ginger Rogers" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db2b3200d img-responsive" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db2b3200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Ginger Rogers" /></a>On May 5, columnist Louella Parsons struck again, writing that Gabin, who was seen around town with Ginger Rogers frequently at this time, wanted Ginger for his co-star and was working on convincing her to take the role. Parsons mentions Ida Lupino as "also in the running". This was just a few months after Ginger Rogers had won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her work the previous year in <em>Kitty Foyle</em>. </p>

<p>Once again, Parsons' reporting led to nothing, as Ginger Rogers' name not does not appear again in connection with the <em>Moontide</em> role. Soon Gabin was seen all around town with Marlene Dietrich. </p>

<p><strong>Back to Ida Lupino</strong></p>

<p>By July 1941, still several months ahead of the scheduled production date, Ida Lupino appears to have been firmly established as Gabin's co-star—both their names are included when 20th Century-Fox hypes their next season's films. And while circumstances could certainly have changed after that point, they did not. </p>

<p>As we saw at the very beginning of this essay, in October, Ida, who was then in a months-long dispute with Warner Bros. over the roles they were assigning her, was publicly expressing her pleasure with the role 20th Century-Fox had given her. When filming of <em>Moontide</em> finally began in November, Ida Lupino was on the job. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971781b200b-pi"><img alt="Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin in Moontide" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971781b200b img-responsive" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971781b200b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin in Moontide" /></a></p></p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>While researching one of my favorite movies—<em>Moontide</em> (1942), starring Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino—I ran across an interesting series of ads for the film in the trade papers. This 20th Century-Fox campaign is extremely focused on hyping up Jean Gabin as a new attraction for the female audience. They were attempting to build him into a new Hollywood leading man—to the extent that virtually nothing else about the movie is mentioned, but the proper pronunciation of Gabin's name is.</p>

<p>Gabin had been a superstar in French films for a few years, but was virtually brand new to American audiences. He had fled his home near Paris in mid-1940, as the German army conquered France, eventually finding himself in Vichy France for a few months. His life and career prospects in Vichy were poor, as he refused to make Nazi propaganda films. At that point, he accepted one of the Hollywood offers that had been coming his way for a while, but which he had always refused before the war.</p>

<p>Gabin arrived in the U.S. in April 1941 knowing just a few words of English. 20th Century-Fox put him on a crash course for several months before at last setting about to make his first American film, <em>Moontide</em>—based on a novel by actor Willard Robertson—in November 1941. The film was ready for release the next spring, by which time, the U.S., too, was at war.</p>

<p>Here are a series of ads that appeared in Motion Picture Daily and Motion Picture Herald in the second half of April, 1942, leading up to the world premiere of <em>Moontide</em> at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City on April 29. The gallery below unfortunately crops each into a square, so be sure to click on each to see the full ad, or click on one on each row and use the arrow keys to navigate back-and-forth.</p>

<p>From mid-May, here is an ad with a different visual style and a large image of Lupino—but it is still all about Gabin. Ok, Ida does get one mention in a pull quote!</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="display: inline;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41c3188200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41c3188200d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; " alt="Moontide.Ad.09.may16" title="Moontide.Ad.09.may16" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41c3188200d-600wi" /></a><br />
<br/></p>

<p>Anyway, <em>Moontide</em> is an unusual and great movie, with excellent performances, and an unforgettable atmosphere. You should see it!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>While researching my essay on <a href="../09/what-happened-to-elinor-norton-1934.html"><em>Elinor Norton</em></a> (1934), I came across a full page ad for Fox Film Corporation from the January 2, 1935 Los Angeles Times. This fascinating ad is a view into the last months of this major studio. </p>

<p>Just a few months later, Fox was taken over by upstart independent studio 20th Century, run by the legendary producer Darryl Zanuck. For nearly a century after that, 20th Century-Fox was one of the preeminent Hollywood studios. (Alas, 20th Century-Fox met its own demise just a couple years ago when Disney swallowed them up.)</p>

<p>Look the ad over carefully. Examine the planned 1935-36 productions of Fox Films. Note their stars. Note their featured players, directors, writer, producers, etc. If I knew more of their later history, that overhead view of their Movietone City campus would be equally fascinating.</p>

<p>Here is the full ad. Click on the image to bring up the full size version.</p>
