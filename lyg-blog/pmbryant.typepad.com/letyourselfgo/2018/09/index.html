We selected a 1943 Lana Turner comedy on FilmStruck, <em>Slightly Dangerous</em>, despite knowing absolutely nothing else about it.</p>

<p>This turned out to be a surprisingly excellent choice. I should not be so surprised, though, as I've enjoyed Lana Turner in other light comedy roles in her early films. </p>

<p>While there is a superb cast supporting her, with Robert Young, Walter Brennan, and May Whitty, Lana carries this film and does so smoothly at it that I wish she had been able to continue doing comedies longer into her career.</p>

<p><em>Spoilers below</em></p>

<p>I also applaud the writers for not taking a cheap way out that I thought they were going to take mid-way through the film, and that I've seen less sophisticated movies take. </p>

<p>For background, early in the film, one of Lana's character's complaints is that she has no family. Later, after she has schemed to pose as the long-lost amnesiac missing daughter of rich businessman Walter Brennan, and Brennan discovers her real name from Robert Young, Brennan suggests that just because her name had been different didn't mean she wasn't really his missing daughter.</p>

<p>At that point, I suspected the writers were going to make Lana turn out to be the real missing daughter in the end, as such a contrivance would diminish the impact of her deception on the well-meaning Brennan character. Certainly plenty of lesser comedies, especially more modern ones, have taken similar artificial turns to make their scheming characters more sympathetic.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the writers did not take that turn that they were cleverly setting up, and instead went down a far more touching and believable path, giving some genuine emotional weight to the film's finale.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A few weeks back, Turner Classic Movies came up with a pleasant surprise by announcing that Glenda Farrell would be their "Star of the Month" for November. And they are backing up that designation in force, showing 48 of her films that month!</p>

<p>I've already seen 28 of her films, and 27 of those are being shown. The only one I've already seen that is missing is <em>The Talk of the Town</em>. The schedule does include some films where Glenda barely has any screen time, such as the otherwise-excellent <em>Three on a Match</em>. But that seems unavoidable when showing so many films of an actress who was primarily in supporting roles.</p>

<p>That leaves 21 potential new films for me, and I hope I'll have enough room on my DVR service to manage them. Most of these I don't know much, or anything, about. Perhaps my top priority is <em>We're In The Money</em>, since that is one of her comic teamings with Joan Blondell, and not available on home video as far as I have found. I've marked that, and other, priorities, with exclamation marks below.</p>

<p>Nov 5:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Kissin' Cousins</em> (1964)</li>
<li><em>Apache War Smoke</em> (1952)</li>
<li>!! <em>Heat Lightning</em> (1934)</li>

<li>!! <em>The Secret Bride (1932)</em>, starring Barbara Stanwyck</li>
<li><em>The Big Shakedown</em> (1934)</li>
</ul>

<p>Nov 12:</p>

<ul>
<li>!! <em>Go Into Your Dance</em> (1935)</li>
<li><em>Life Begins</em> (1932)</li>
<li>!! <em>Hi Nellie!</em> (1934)</li>
</ul>

<p>Nov 19:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Central Airport</em> (1933)</li>
<li><em>Snowed Under</em> (1936)</li>
<li>!! <em>We're In The Money</em> (1935), one of her teamings with Joan Blondell</li>
</ul>

<p>Nov 26:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The Personality Kid</em> (1934) </li>

<li>!! <em>Girl Missing</em> (1933) </li>
<li>!! <em>Lady For A Day</em> (1933)</li>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My Facebook movie writings ceased after September 2015, with &quot;<a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/flyingdowntooldhollywood/2018/09/the-animal-kingdom-1932.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Animal Kingdom</a>&quot; being my final film post on Facebook. I had been finding it very hard to keep up with our viewing. To help, in August of that year, I started keeping a list of films we watched, so I could keep track of which ones I still needed to write about.</p>
<p>But it soon became clear I had no hope of keeping up. Looking at the list, I watched ten films in September 2015, but I only wrote three posts. In addition becoming discouraged from falling behind, I was boring myself with my unimaginative prose. I did not know how to write about films. I still don&#39;t know, but I am going to try again. And hopefully I will get better as I go along.</p>
<p>Encouragingly, I&#39;ve actually managed to keep up that list of films. So now I have a comprehensive list of films I have watched going back over three years--dominated by old Hollywood films from the 1930s and 1940s. And using my old Facebook posts, I can re-construct a mostly-complete list back another year. If I ever get around to diving into my Netflix DVD history, I may be able to go back even further, though with less precise dates, which should cover my entire history of strong interest in classic films.</p>
<p>As my list continues to grow, I plan resume writing about the old Hollywood films I add to it, and related subjects I find interesting.</p>

<p>We just stumbled across the film The Animal Kingdom, an RKO film from 1932, and very much enjoyed it. It is definitely pre-code, as the plot involves sex and co-habitation outside of marriage and other subjects that would soon be taboo in Hollywood films. Because of that, the film does feel quite unusual for the era.</p>
<p>This was my first significant exposure to both Leslie Howard and Ann Harding. Harding's role is surprisingly small given her top billing. Myrna Loy actually is the female lead and she is extremely impressive. This was apparently a critical role in launching her to stardom. Leslie Howard is great as well.</p>

<p>It had been a few months since we had seen a new (for us) Judy Garland film. The drought finally ended a couple weeks back with In The Good Old Summertime. Our expectations were fulfilled, as it was a very enjoyable movie with good music and performances.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t have any big production numbers, but Judy singing is quite a production by itself. And it does have one of my all-time favorite of Judy&#39;s performances in her song-and-dance to &quot;I Don&#39;t Care,&quot; which I had seen cli<span class="text_exposed_show">ps of earlier and was eagerly anticipating. </span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>In The Good Old Summertime is a 1949 Technicolor MGM musical re-make of the 1940 non-musical Ernst Lubitsch comedy The Shop Around The Corner. Judy and Van Johnson star, taking the roles of Margaret Sullivan and James Stewart. The setting has been moved to a music store in turn-of-the-century Chicago. But many of the characters, sets, and scenes are eerily reminiscent of the earlier film. It&#39;s been 2-3 years since we watched The Shop Around The Corner but at times Van Johnson seemed to me to morph into Jimmy Stewart. This is not a bad thing; the Lubitsch version was excellent.</p>

<p>From my Facebook archives, September 12, 2015:</p>
<p>I need to see more Barbara Stanwyck films. She is tremendous in Stella Dallas, a 1937 epic drama from Samuel Goldwyn studios. She was nominated for an Academy Award for this performance but somehow did not win. The film is Barbara&#39;s all the way but Ann Shirley and especially Alan Hale, neither of wham I was previously familiar with, put in impressive performances of their own.</p>
<p>The other Stanwyck films I&#39;ve seen are, most recently, Night Nurse and Double Indemnity, and, over the last 2-3 years, the Preston Sturges comedy The Lady Eve and Baby Face. All are excellent films.</p>
<p>The director, King Vidor, had an impressive career of his own. For us recently, he is notable for having directed the Kansas scenes in The Wizard of Oz, including Judy Garland&#39;s &#39;Over The Rainbow&#39; performance.&#0160;</p>

<p>From my Facebook archives, August 31, 2015:</p>
<p>That Uncertain Feeling is a 1941 comedy from Ernst Lubitsch. While not an all-time classic like some of his others, it was fun and enjoyable. This is yet another old comedy with a plot centered on the difficulty of obtaining a divorce.</p>
<p>It was the first Merle Oberon film we've seen and she was quite good, though I believe she is better known for dramas. Melvyn Douglas continues to win me over after an initial bad impression from Theodora Goes Wild. And Burgess Meredith was hilarious in this film as an egocentric musician and Douglas' rival.</p>

<p>From my Facebook archives, August 30, 2015:</p>
<p>I&#39;ve gotten way behind on writing about the classic Hollywood films we&#39;ve seen in recent weeks. One I do want to be sure to mention is Random Harvest, a 1942 MGM romantic drama.</p>
<p>The premise is far-fetched but the story is magical and extremely well told nonetheless. The shortcomings it has all fade away and become irrelevant.</p>
<p>I&#39;m already a big fan of Ronald Colman, and this film alone turned me into a big fan of Greer Garson.</p>

<p>Update September 2018: Alas, I somehow didn&#39;t manage to see a second Greer Garson film for over three years--until just a couple weeks ago, when I saw a rather ordinary comedy &quot;Remember?&quot; from 1939. This was one of Garson&#39;s first starring roles and one of her few comedies. She still lit up the screen, so I must seek out more of her films.</p>
